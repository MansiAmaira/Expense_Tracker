## Packages
date-fns | Formatting dates for display
recharts | Visualizing expense distribution
framer-motion | Smooth animations for lists and transitions
lucide-react | Beautiful icons

## Notes
- Currency formatting should handle the string numbers from backend
- Date handling needs to bridge Date objects (UI) and ISO strings (API)
- Tailwind Config needs font family extensions for 'Outfit' (display) and 'DM Sans' (body)
