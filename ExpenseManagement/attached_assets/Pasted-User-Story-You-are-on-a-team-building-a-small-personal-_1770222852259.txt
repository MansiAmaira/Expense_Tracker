User Story
You are on a team building a small personal finance tool.
As a user, I can record and review my personal expenses so I can understand
where my money is going.
This tool is assumed to be used in real-world conditions (unreliable networks,
browser refreshes, retries).
Acceptance criteria (for this exercise):
1. User can create a new expense entry with amount, category, description,
and date.
2. User can view a list of expenses.
3. User can filter expenses by category.
4. User can sort expenses by date (newest first).
5. User can see a simple total of expenses for the current list (e.g., “Total:
₹X”).
Aim for production-like quality while keeping the feature set small.

The Assignment
You are responsible for a minimal full-stack Expense Tracker: a backend API
and a simple frontend UI.
Assume this is something you might extend and maintain over time, not a
throwaway prototype.

Backend (Required)
Implement a small API that supports:
POST /expenses
Create a new expense.
Request body should include: amount, category, description, date.

Assignment 1

The API should behave correctly even if the client retries the same request
due to network issues or page reloads.
GET /expenses
Return a list of expenses.
Support optional query parameters:
category (filter by category)
sort=date_desc (sort by date, newest first)
Data model (minimum):
id
amount (use an appropriate type for real money)
category
description
date
created_at
You can choose any reasonable persistence mechanism (e.g., in-memory store,
JSON file, SQLite, relational DB, no-SQL DB).
Explain your choice briefly in the README.

Frontend (Required)
Implement a simple web UI that talks to your API:
A form to add a new expense (amount, category, description, date).
A list/table of existing expenses.
Controls to:
Filter by category.
Sort by date (newest first).
Display the total amount of the currently visible expenses (after
filters/sorting).
Assume users may:

Assignment 2

Click submit multiple times
Refresh the page after submitting
Experience slow or failed API responses
Keep styling simple; focus on correctness and clarity.

Nice to Have
Only attempt these if you have time left after finishing the core:
Basic validation (e.g., prevent negative amounts, require a date).
A summary view (e.g., total per category).
A couple of small automated tests (unit or integration).
Basic error and loading states in the UI.
Prioritize what you think adds the most real value.

Constraints & Expectations
You may use any frameworks, libraries, or tools you would normally use on
the job.
You are welcome to use AI-assisted tools (e.g., Copilot, LLMs).
Include a short note in your README explaining:
Key design decisions
Trade-offs you made because of the timebox
Anything you intentionally did not do

What Will Be Evaluated
We are not looking for feature completeness.
We will evaluate:
Whether your system behaves correctly under realistic conditions.
How you think about data correctness, money handling, and edge cases.
Code clarity and structure.

Assignment 3

Your judgment in choosing what matters vs what doesn’t.

How to Submit
Share a link to a repository containing your code and README.
Share a link to access the live and deployed application
Repo structure is up to you (monorepo or separate folders).
